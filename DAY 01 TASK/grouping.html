            <li>The CSS grouping selector is used to select multiple elements and style them together.</li>
            <li>This reduces the code zand extra effort to declare common styles for each element. To group selectors, each selector is separated by a space.z</li>
            <li>CSS selectors define the pattern to select elements to which a set of CSS rules are then applied.</li>
            <li>CSS selectors can be grouped into the following categories based on the type of elements they can select.</li>
            <li>So far, all of our selectors have only targeted one class, one ID or one element.</li>
            <li>However, CSS makes it ridiculously easy to target more than one element at the same time, allowing you to specify the same properties and rules for more than one element at the same time - just separate the selector names with a comma and you're good to go</li>
